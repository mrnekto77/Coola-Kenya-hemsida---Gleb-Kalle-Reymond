                <span>
                    In Kenya, Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays, marking the long weekend commemorating Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. Good Friday often sees processions through the streets with dramatic recreations of the Stations of the Cross, culminating in church services. Saturday often involves a bonfire outside the church and the lighting of candles and prayers inside, with Sunday being a feast marked by singing, bell-ringing, church services, and family togetherness.

                <span>
                   Eid Al Fitr is an Islamic celebration that usually takes place in September, when the sighting of the moon marks the end of the Muslim holy month of fasting during Ramadan. Eid celebrations usually involve personal cleansing, communal prayers, charity donations, and three full days of feasting and spending time with friends and family. The celebrations are biggest along the coastal areas where most of the Muslim population of Kenya lives.

                  The annual International Camel Derby and Festival has been held on the outskirts of Maralal town in northern Kenya since 1990.

Visitors come from all over the world to take part or watch, and there are also cycle races, donkey rides, children’s entertainment, and the opportunity to rent a camel for the day. The derby usually takes place in August.
